Elastic makes Elasticsearch and Kibana, and this research covers Elasticsearch as a retrieval store with RBAC and document-level security, Elastic Agent Builder, Elastic Security for AI workloads and Elastic Observability LLM and agent monitoring (LLM integrations, the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore integration and Agent Builder traces).

Column group: Retrieval and search. Facts are agent-run. Cells listed as eligible are the only ones agents may retrieve.
